### Environments:
- Pytorch-GPU
- Python 3.6
- Google Colab

### How to Run the Code (Recommend to run the code on Colab)
You, firstly, need to download the dataset [STC-3](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/challenge/dataset_description/). If you are going to run the code on the Colab, then you need to upload the dataset to your personal google drive.

No matter which way you choose to run this code, you need to change the path in the code:
```
path = './drive/stc-3_emotion_train.json' [Change it to where the data is in your PC / google drive]
```
